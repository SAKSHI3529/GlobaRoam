            Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago. It’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality as well as exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of exotic, local cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors.

        <p class="discription2">
            Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles offer plenty to see and do, but you won't want to stay away from the coastline for long. Popular beach resorts include Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many of the finest hotels and villas look over world-class surf spots. For tranquil seascapes and sunrises, Sanur, Nusa Dua and remote Candidasa are your best bets. Bali’s lesser travelled eastern and northern regions also offer wonderful diving spots in calm bays, with coral gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.

                            Beaches in Bali come in a rich assortment and each is a favourite destination on its own. Bali beaches range from palm-fringed white sand coasts on the island’s south such as Kuta, Nusa Dua and Sanur, to the cliff-guarded ‘hidden’ shores of Uluwatu, Padang Padang, Dreamland and Bingin. Bali beaches also comprise striking black sands on the north and western shorelines, with sleepy undisturbed coves in-between.

                            Goa Gajah is one of Bali’s most significant archaeological sites. Believed to be a former hermitage, the complex features a stone relic-filled courtyard before a temple and the focal attraction of a central meditational cave. The courtyard also has exotic bathing pools and sculpted fountains. To the unknowing, Goa Gajah’s name which translates to ‘Elephant Cave’ can be slightly misleading – there are no pachyderms here.
