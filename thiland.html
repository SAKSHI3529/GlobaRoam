            Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago. It’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality as well as exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of exotic, local cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors.

        <p class="discription2">
            Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles offer plenty to see and do, but you won't want to stay away from the coastline for long. Popular beach resorts include Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many of the finest hotels and villas look over world-class surf spots. For tranquil seascapes and sunrises, Sanur, Nusa Dua and remote Candidasa are your best bets. Bali’s lesser travelled eastern and northern regions also offer wonderful diving spots in calm bays, with coral gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.

The main highlight here is the 39-foot-high Buddha statue, known as Big Buddha. The icon is so vast that it is visible from kilometers away. A flight of stairs leads to the statue, and there are stalls selling souvenirs and knick-knacks at the base of the stairs. Dress appropriately.

                            Tarnim Magic Garden, also known as the Secret Buddha Garden is a private sculpture park set atop one of the highest peaks on the island. Also called the ‘Heaven's Garden’ or the ‘Magic Garden,’ the main highlight is the group of angel and musician statues. Set amidst lush jungle foliage, there are waterfalls and streams, along with Buddha statues hidden in plain sight. The view from the garden and the way leading up to it is stunning.

Apart from this, statues depict different aspects of Thai Buddhism, along with snakes, birds, and other animals. The verdant garden also houses the statue of Nim Thongsuk's parents and his own tomb.

Divers venturing deeper into the water might even spot whale sharks, and the nudibranchs and shrimps hiding between crevices underwater make for amazing photographs.
